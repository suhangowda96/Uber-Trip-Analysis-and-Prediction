# Uber Trip Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover patterns and forecast trip demand. By applying time series analysis and regression techniques, the goal is to provide actionable insights for resource allocation and operational efficiency.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Uber trip dataset (e.g., from Kaggle)
- **Description**: Contains historical trip records with features like trip start time, duration, distance, and location coordinates.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing or duplicate records and standardized date/time formats.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created time-based features (e.g., hour, day of the week, month) to capture temporal patterns.
- **Normalization**: Scaled numerical features to improve model performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized trip volumes and trends over time using time series plots.
- Explored seasonal patterns and peak hours.
- Analyzed distributions of trip distances and durations to understand variability.

## Modeling
- **Approach**: Combined time series analysis with regression techniques.
- **Techniques**: Used ARIMA for time series forecasting and Random Forest Regression for predicting trip demand.
- **Evaluation**: Measured performance with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results
- Achieved accurate forecasts of trip demand.
- Identified key temporal trends that can help optimize resource allocation during peak times.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suhangowda96/uber-trip-analysis.git
